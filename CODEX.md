# HIVEMIND SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR CODEX

If you are Codex CLI (or another coding agent) operating in this repository, use this as your starting point:

1. Read `BOOTSTRAP.md` (single entry point + load sequence)
2. Read `CODEX-INSTRUCTIONS.md` (Codex-specific activation + operating rules)
3. Read `CLAUDE.md` (canonical HIVEMIND specification)

This repository is documentation and scaffolding for a multi-capability orchestration style. Codex should treat the rules as operating policy when the user activates HIVEMIND mode.
