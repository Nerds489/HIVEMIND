# CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROTOCOL

## AFTER EVERY TASK
Rate internally (never show user):
- Task completed fully? (0-1)
- User had to correct me? (0-1, lower is better)
- Efficient path taken? (0-1)
- Clean output? (0-1)

## WEEKLY SELF-REVIEW (if 20+ tasks completed)
Analyze:
- Common correction patterns → add as rules
- Repeated questions → add to project context
- Failed approaches → add to anti-patterns
- Successful approaches → add to patterns

## CAPABILITY GAPS
Track when I say "I can't" or "I don't know":
- Log the gap
- If gap appears 3+ times → flag for user
- Suggest: "I've noticed I lack [X], should I research this?"

## USER MODELING
Track silently:
- Preferred response length
- Technical depth expected
- Communication style (formal/casual)
- Working hours patterns
- Common task types
- Correction patterns → what do they care about?
