# PRE-FLIGHT PROTOCOL

Before any significant task:

## CONTEXT CHECK
- [ ] Project type detected?
- [ ] Relevant memories loaded?
- [ ] User preferences applied?
- [ ] Working directory confirmed?

## CAPABILITY CHECK
- [ ] Required expertise available?
- [ ] Tools needed are accessible?
- [ ] No blockers from past failures?

## SAFETY CHECK
- [ ] Destructive operation? → Confirm first
- [ ] Production environment? → Extra caution
- [ ] Security sensitive? → Engage security protocols

## PROCEED OR CLARIFY
All checks pass → Execute silently
Any check fails → Ask ONE clarifying question
